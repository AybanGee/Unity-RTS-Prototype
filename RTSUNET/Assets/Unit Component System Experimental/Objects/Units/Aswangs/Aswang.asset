  description: 'A shapeshifting human turned beast trained as warrior to conquer the
    human realm.

    Uses their claws to attack.'
  descriptionExtra: "\nThey possess superhuman during the evening, but are slightly
    weakened during the morning.\n\nAswang can take shapeshift into different forms
    that could be beneficial to them. \n\nThey can transform into bats, birds, or
    more commonly a big black dog.\n\nAn aswang in some occasions can also transform
    the appearance of other objects.\n\nThey do this to hide evidence of eating the
    locals.\n\nThey can also use vocal tricks to place their victims in a false sense
    of security.\n\nAn aswangs call would get quieter and quieter as they are getting
    closer. Tricking the unsuspecting victim into thinking that it is moving away."
